# Predicting-Customer-Churn-Using-Tree-methods
The telecommunication business involves the development, ownership, or operation of one or more telephone, telecommunications or information systems. Typically, telecom companies provide infrastructure to enable clients to transmit voice, video, and data. When a customer (subscriber) discontinues his or her association with a company, this is referred to as customer churn. Businesses usually consider a client to be churned after a certain length of time has passed since the consumer's last interaction with the site or service. Customer churn costs include lost revenue and the marketing costs associated with acquiring new customers. Client turnover must be reduced since the cost of obtaining a new customer is higher than the cost of retaining an existing one. Every company's primary business goal is to reduce client attrition. This Project is related to the telecom business, in this project, we aim to find the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be implemented to avert this problem.

This notebook explains all the steps involved in tree methods modelling for Customer churn rate prediction .
